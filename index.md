I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science,
University of Milano-Bicocca. My research interests are in the field
of algorithms and complexity theory. I am particularly interested in
some problems in Computational Biology, such as the Multiple Sequence
Alignment, Phylogeny Reconstruction, 
and Gene Structure Inference. I am a member of
[BIAS](http://algolab.eu/), a research
group on Bionformatics and Experimental Algorithmics.


## Research

I have made available a preprint of my recent papers at
[ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/dellavedova_g_1) or [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/search/author1%3AGianluca%2BDella%2BVedova), and I plan to do so for
the foreseeable future. A [graphical summary](https://is.gd/mYcEj1) of
my research interests.

My ORCID is
[0000-0001-5584-3089](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5584-3089)

##    Software

The most relevant software are:

*  [cppp](https://github.com/AlgoLab/cppp): a program to compute the
Constrained Persistent Phylogeny
*  [PIntron](http://PIntron.algolab.eu/): A novel pipeline for
gene-structure prediction based on spliced alignment of transcript
sequences (ESTs and mRNAs) against a genomic sequence.
*  [reduceLCS](https://github.com/gdv/Reduce-Expand-for-LCS): a fast
program to compute the approximate Longest Commons Subsequence of a
set of strings.
*  [SASC](https://github.com/sciccolella/sasc/): a fast and precise tool for cancer
progression inference from single-cell data.
*  [ASGAL](https://asgal.algolab.eu/): a tool to discover new alternative splicing events


All my software is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/gdv).

*   No software patents. A program is a way to express algorithms, which are
    not patentable by the Bern convention. Then why should you want to patent
    a program?
*   [Email Charter](http://emailcharter.org/) We're drowning in email. We can reverse this spiral only by mutual agreement.
*   [Science Code Manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/) Software is a
    cornerstone of science. Without software, twenty-first century science
    would be impossible. Without better software, science cannot progress. But the culture and institutions of science have not yet adjusted to this reality.
