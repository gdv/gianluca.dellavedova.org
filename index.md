I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science,
University of Milano-Bicocca. My research interests are in the field
of algorithms and complexity theory. I am particularly interested in
some problems in Computational Biology, such as the Multiple Sequence
Alignment, Phylogeny Reconstruction, Probe Selection for DNA arrays
and Gene Structure Inference. I am a member of
[AlgoLab](http://algolab.eu/), a research
group on Experimental Algorithmics, with a special focus on algorithms
for biology.

I have worked on (and I am still loosely interested in) some problems
related to the modular decomposition of graphs and hypergraphs, as
well as the modeling of data bases by graphs.

##Research

I have made available a preprint of my recent papers at
[ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/dellavedova_g_1), and I plan to do so for
the foreseeable future.

Almost all my papers are indexed at the wonderful
[DBLP](http://dblp.org/pers/hc/v/Vedova:Gianluca_Della.html).

A list of my publications is also at
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0gaIFokAAAAJ)
and at
[BOA](https://boa.unimib.it/browse?type=author&amp;authority=rp06846)
(Bicocca Open Archive): the institutional achive of my university.


My ORCID is

My research group can be found at [AlgoLab](http://www.algolab.eu).
