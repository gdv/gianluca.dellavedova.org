<h3>What is Computational Biology?</h3>
<p>The development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems. Working Definition of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology - NIH, July 17, 2000.</p>
<h3>On Algorithms.</h3>
<p>People who analyze algorithms have double happiness. First of all they experience the sheer beauty of elegant mathematical patterns that surround elegant computational procedures. Then they receive a practical payoff when their theories make it possible to get other jobs done more quickly and more economically. Donald Knuth</p>
