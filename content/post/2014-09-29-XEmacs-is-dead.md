I used to love XEmacs, but it has been [declared
dead](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/04/xemacs-is-dead-long-live-xemacs.html) years ago.

I used it to write papers and several programs. I even used it to write my Ph.D. thesis. I have read and appreciated jwz [tirade](https://www.jwz.org/doc/lemacs.html) against GNU Emacs, and I think he’s right.

Anyway, some years ago (I think about 10 years ago) I switched back to GNU Emacs and I’ve never looked back. Still, up until now I have seen XEmacs as a nice project. But now the leader of XEmacs states that he would oppose any improvement to Emacs that “[makes it even harder for XEmacs to catch up](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2014-09/msg00460.html)“. That only means that it is time to stop thinking about XEmacs and go on.
