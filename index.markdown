I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Statistics, University of
Milano-Bicocca. My research interests are in the field of algorithms and
complexity theory. I am particularly interested in some problems in
Computational Biology, such as the Multiple Sequence Alignment, Phylogeny
Reconstruction, and Probe Selection for DNA arrays. I am leading a new project
called ALiBio (short for Algorithms Library for Bioinformatics), which aims to
be a building block for Bioinformatics programs. I am also involved with the
Bioinformatics Research Group at the Department of Computer Science.

I have worked on (and I am still loosely interested in) some problems related
to the modular decomposition of graphs and hypergraphs, as well as the
modeling of data bases by means of graphs.

### Education

*     2000: Ph.D. Computer Science (Universit&agrave;&nbsp; di Milano), thesis
