*   No software patents. A program is a way to express algorithms, which are
    not patentable by the Bern convention. Then why should you want to patent
    a program?
*   [Email Charter](http://emailcharter.org/) We're drowning in email. We can reverse this spiral only by mutual agreement.
*   [Science Code Manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/) Software is a
    cornerstone of science. Without software, twenty-first century science
    would be impossible. Without better software, science cannot progress. But the culture and institutions of science have not yet adjusted to this reality.
